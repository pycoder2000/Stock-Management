<h3 align="center">View Graph</h3>

<b>Description</b> : The viewgraph functionality is a very useful tool for the user. It enables the user to view and analyze trends for any stock right here in the app, without the need to go to another site for the same. It is a very extensive tool and we have enabled this with the help of a plotly graph called stock-graphic, which is a stock visualization graph. It allows the user to view trends of multiple stocks at the same time, within any given date range.

It uses a simple linear regression algorithm that makes predictions based on the previous prices of the said stock. The tool takes the ticker of the stock and the number of days to predict for as the input, and then gives out the predicted values and the accuracy of those values, as the output.
